Your mission is to build a system for the elves, enabling them to input names and tally each childs deeds to keep track of whether they’re good or bad. You could even categorise these automatically as “naughty” and “nice.” Fortunately, the elves have been meticulous in their record-keeping and have a backup of all the current data in JSON format. You’ll need to import this data into your newly developed system.
